when doing a whole folder export from ELAN 6.3, select export multiple files as... and the tab-delimited text options
you'll then be prompted to create or select a pre-existing domain. if this is your first time exporting a specific folder, you will have to create a domain
once the domain has been created/selected, click the desired tiers to be exported (Infant Voc Type, Adult Utterance Direction, Music, and Background Overlap in this project's case)
under the output options, make sure to select the seperate column for each tier and that the "Repeat values of annotations spanning other annotations" is NOT selected. 
Begin Time, End Time and Duration also need to be selected
as for the time format, ss.msec is the preferred one
